Various plugins for https://github.com/otfbot

Please read _there how to use and install.
These might be some more examples how to write plugins.

btw, the nip.py is a terrific extraordinary quiz-game and needs players :-)
The bot controls gameplay, although it won't raise
the questions as usual. Very unusal but very funny kind of quiz.

I'll support these only on freenode.net/#otfbot, so you know where to find help...
