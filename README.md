Various plugins for https://github.com/otfbot

Please read _there how to use and install.
These might be some more examples how to write plugins.

btw, the nip.py is a terrific extraordinary quiz-game and needs players :-)
Needs to be i18n'ed 
The bot controls the run of play, although it won't raise
the questions as usual.

I'll support these only on freenode, so you know where to find help...


A note on pep8:
After respecting pep8 for a bunch of time, I won't agree with pep8 at all.
If you get angry about my decision, you are going to be reassed on fascism 
and you should really reveal the true nature of GPL'd code and the GPL itself at all, 
Since pep8 in fact does _not_ harmonise with the temperament of the GPL.

e.g. Trying to force coding-style _is_ facism nothing else, and I'll never will
support religious fanatics who think they could force a global coding-style.
Letting code with "4 hardcoded whitespaces" instead of modern soft-tabs ist somewhat 
stone-aged and not pursuable.
Unfortunately most pep8 people don't have the skill to reflect about disapprovals.
Coding-Style will ever be a democratic project rule, not a forced decision
by few people.
So, I say, tabbing code with soft-tabs is up to date, all the same
on which language. Python does not have any problems as long you are
using the same style and intends  within any module.

So pep8 is not going to bother me anymore,
because I won't support choking on varity and diversity at all.
Simple as that.
